## Deep Learning with PyTorch - Image Classifier

### Project Overview
In this project I use deep learning with PyTorch to make an image classifier that predicts the top K flower classes and their associated probabilities from a picture.  

### Project Files
- The `Image Classifier Project_GCP_FINAL.ipynb` file contains the Jupyter Notebook for the design, training, testing and evaluation of the deep learning model.
- The `Image Classifier Project_GCP_GPU.ipynb` file contains the Jupyter Notebook for the design, training, testing and evaluation of the deep learning model done on GPU on Google Colab.
- Data Includes images of 102 Flowers. The flowers folder is divided in Train, Valid, Test sub folders
